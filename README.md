All you need to know about the documentation is in the ```docs``` folder. There you will find all the information about the assembly, the code documentation (which I thought it necessary to describe), as well as a technical guide for installing a server on Windows.

Game server Lineage 2, which is not based on any source code. We are the first after l2j who started our own development from scratch. In addition, we write full-fledged support (in the form of libraries and moduls) for different protocols, which means that you can do lib replacing any protocol you need and core will be listen it, you can run our product on any client (which is supported or will).
The plans are to start with interlude, and then move on to the higher chronicles of the most popular assemblies: Epilogue, Gracia, High Five, Helios, Classic, etc.
In addition, my colleague and I are conducting our own development, which is called DOE, but you know about it early;).
