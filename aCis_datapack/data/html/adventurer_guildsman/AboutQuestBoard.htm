In each city there are bulletin boards. These are the main objectives of the city, which must be performed for the current day. Travelers and adventurers, mighty warriors and great wizards - each using their skills for the good of the city.<br>
So, before you stand on a par with those I listed, you should know the following...<br>
At the end of the day at <font color=LEVEL>%updateTime%</font> the city quests/requirements are updated. At this time - new tasks are posted on the board and for some time it <font color=LEVEL>may be unavailable</font>.<br1>
You will be able to see only those quests, that are <font color=LEVEL>suitable for your grade</font>. For example, a hunter of the 7th level - sees quests for 1~19 levels.<br1>
It is important for the city not to kill its hunters, so a kind of protection has been created that does not allow us to take the quest from the highest grade.<br1>
In total, up to <font color=LEVEL>%maxQuests% quests</font> are posted on the board inclusive. After the quest is taken by the hunter, <font color=LEVEL>another hunter will not be able to take it until the quest is canceled or failed</font>.
If the quest is done, the hunter writes his name on the back of the page and later receives an award. Some quests can be rewarded permanntly upon their will be done.<br>
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, due to the fact that some hunters do not act in good faith, we brought a magical restriction that <font color=LEVEL>does not allow the hunter to take more than 1 quest</font> at time.<br1>
But!<br1>
That seems to be all the nuances...<br1>
You will also learn about rewards when viewing a sheet with a quest. It seems there should be written that for this quest - the hunter will receive.<br>
Now go, and good luck to you %playerName%!<br>
